### 3.1. The Frontend

To work with your frontend code locally with the web server, you may have to run another web server to serve the frontend's static files.

To do this, run the following command once on your machine:

`$ npm install --global http-server`

Then whenever you want to start your server, run the following in your project's root folder:

`$ npx http-server frontend -c 1 -p [port]`

Where `[port]` is the port you want to run the server on (e.g. `8080`). Any number is fine.

This will start up a second HTTP server where if you navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or whatever URL/port it provides) it will run your `index.html` without any CORs issues.

### 3.2. The Backend

The backend server exists in your individual repository. After you clone this repo, you must run `yarn install` in `backend` directory once.

To run the backend server, simply run `yarn start` in the `backend` directory. This will start the backend.

Once the backend has started, you can view the API documentation by navigating to `http://localhost:[port]` in a web browser.

The port that the backend runs on (and that the frontend can use) is specified in `frontend/src/config.js`. You can change the port in this file. This file exists so that your frontend knows what port to use when talking to the backend.

Please note: If you manually update database.json you will need to restart your server.
